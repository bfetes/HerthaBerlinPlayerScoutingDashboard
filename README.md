# HerthaBerlinPlayerScoutingDashboard

After fending off relegation in 2020, Hertha Berlin brough in new sporting director, Fredi Bobic in 2021. While Bobic offloaded expensive players and trimmed the budget, the team was short on highly skilled players, barely fending off relegation again in 2021. The Hertha Berlin Player Scouting Dashboard is built to allow a front office the ability to scout, analyze, and compare talent across various leagues, in this specific case, the Allsvenskan (Sweden), Eliteserien (Norway), and Superliga (Denmark). With this dashboard, a scout can identify promising players, see how they rank compared to other players in the pool, and then compare the selected player to the current squad to see if the selected replacement will improve the squad for the 2022/2023 season.
